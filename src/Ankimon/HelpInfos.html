<h1>The Upcoming Guide to Ankimon</h1>

<h2>How to Start</h2>
<ol>
    <li>After you first installed Ankimon, on the next Anki start up, you will be asked to download the file resources.
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to: "Ankimon" =&gt; "Download Resources"</li>
            <li>Accept terms and conditions to download all needed files to run Ankimon.</li>
            <li>After all files have been downloaded, close and reopen Anki.</li>
            <li>On the next startup, you will be able to choose a starter Pokémon. After choosing your starter Pokémon, you will be told to restart Anki.</li>
            <li>Once you have restarted Anki, Ankimon is fully functional.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Ankimon Window</h2>
<p>Your Ankimon window is a second window you can have open next to your reviews to see the battle between your Pokémon and enemy Pokémon happening. This window is needed to be able to catch Pokémon (or defeat them for XP if you like). You can manually open the Ankimon window by going to the "Open Ankimon Window" button. You can only open and close the Ankimon Window with the key you choose in your configuration and cmd / ctrl. For example, the standard configuration is M + cmd for Mac / for Windows and Linux M + ctrl. You will always be provided with the enemy HP, name, and picture in your reviewer window. After a certain number of reviewed cards, a random attack of your main Pokémon is selected and will then hurt the wild Pokémon. Once the enemy Pokémon reaches 0 HP, your Ankimon window will display a Pokedex-a-like theme, and you can choose to defeat the Pokémon or catch it. A new wild Pokémon will appear after choosing one of both options.</p>

<h2>Show Pokémon Collection</h2>
<p>You are able to see your Pokémon by going to the top of buttons in Anki. There, you can check out your collected Pokémon for now. You can pick a new main Pokémon you want to train right now by clicking the "Pick as main Pokémon" button. This Pokémon can now be trained by reviewing Anki cards. To train different Pokémon, you need to pick a different main Pokémon in your Pokémon collection window!</p>

<h3>Pokémon Details</h3>
<p>In the Details window, you can view several options such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trade your Pokémon with friends.</li>
    <li>Release Pokémon you have already caught, if you don't want them anymore.</li>
    <li>Rename Pokémon.</li>
    <li>Remember Attacks if you want your Pokémon to relearn old attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collecting Items and Achievements</h2>
<p>You can also collect items and achievements (badges), which can be overviewed through the Ankimon buttons: "Ankimon" =&gt; "Achievements" and "Items". A cool feature is to simulate battles between your main Pokémon or Pokémon collection; you can export all your Pokémon collections info and create a team on Pokémon Showdown. For this, use the buttons: "Export main Pokémon to Pkmn Showdown" or "Export all Pokémon to Pkmn Showdown". The needed infos are then copied to your clipboard. Then simply use the buttons in the Ankimon button layout: "Open Pokémon Showdown Teambuilder" or visit through your browser. There, you can create a team by pressing "new Team" and then "import from text or URL" - here you need to paste the infos already copied from Anki and then save your team. Important: you may need to play around with certain abilities or stats or moves because Pokémon Showdown formats have different rules which are complicated to overview. Make changes as needed. Most often the format: "anything goes generation 9" works best. You also need to validate your team if everything is correct. Once the team is built, you can play with your friends or other Ankimon users only and battle with your Ankimon team.</p>
