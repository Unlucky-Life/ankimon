  => to do this please navigate to: "Ankimon" => "Download Resources"
  https://ibb.co/n88b1gC (image url) => https://ibb.co/QnVHX6p (image url)
  => once you accept terms and conditions the addon will download all needed files you need to run ankimon
  => After all files have been downloaded. Close and open Anki
  => On the next start up you will be able to choose a starter pokemon - after choosing your starter pokemon, it will tell to restart your anki
  => Once you have restarted your anki, ankimon is fully functional.

Ankimon Window:
  - your ankimon window is a second window you can have open next to your reviews to see the battle between your pokemon and enemy pokemon happening
  - this window is needed to be able to catch pokemon (or defeat them for xp if you like)
  - you can manually open the ankimon window by going to the "Open Ankimon Window" Button: https://ibb.co/GCzxbr6 (image url)
  - You can only open and close the Ankimon Window with the key you choose in your configuration and cmd / ctrl.
For example standard configuration (M + cmd for Mac / for Windows and Linux M + crlt)
  - you will be always provided with the enemy hp and name and picture in your reviewer window (where you review your anki cards.
  - after a certain number of reviewed cards a random attack of your main pokemon is selected and will then hurt the wild pokemon
  - once the enemy pokemon reached 0 hp - your ankimon window will display a pokedex-a-like theme and you can choose to defeat the pokemon or catch it
   - after choosing one of both a new wild pokemon will appear.

When not Opening the Ankimon window => "Grind Mode" is activated and you can only gain xp / level up your pokemon.
  (To catch any of the Pokemon, you need to have Ankimon Window open.!)

You are able to see your pokemon by going to the top of buttons in Anki

=> Show Pokemon Collection
  - There you can check out your collected Pokemon for now.
  - You can pick a new main pokemon you want to train right now by clicking the "Pick as main Pokemon" Button.
    - This is pokemon can now be trained by reviewing anki cards
    - To train different Pokemon you need to pick a different main pokemon in your pokemon collection window !
  - By going on "Show me Details" you can see your pokemon in detail with stats, ability, xp, moves...
    - in the Details window you can view you can do several things such as:
      => Trade your Pokemon with friends
        - When pressing "Trade Pokemon" a window will pop up, give you a code you can send your friend you want to trade with
          - below the given pokemon code, you can reenter the pokemon code of your friend
            - once you press "Trade Pokemon" in the new window - you switch your pokemon with your friend
      => Release Pokemon
        => you can release pokemon you have already caught, if you dont want them any more.
        => if you pres this, they will be released from your collection
      => Rename Pokemon
        => you can enter a nickname for your pokemon and press "Rename Pokemon" to release it
      => Remember Attacks
        => if you want your pokemon to relearn old attacks you can press on "remember attacks" and a window will pop up with all possible moves your pokemon can learn
=> you can also collect items and achievements (badges) which can be overviewed through the Ankimon Buttons: "Ankimon" => "Achievements" and "Items"
=> cool feature: to simulate battles between your main pokemon or pokemon collection you can export all your pokemon collections infos and create a team on pokemonshowdown
  - for this use the buttons: "Export main pokemon to Pkmn showdown" or "Export all pokemon to Pkmn showdown":
  - the needed infos are then copied to your clipboard => and then simply use the buttons in the ankimon button layout:
    - "Open PokemonShowdown Teambuilder" or visit through your browser: https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder.
      - there you can create a team by pressing "new Team" and then "import from text or url" - here you need to paste the infos already copied from anki
      - and then save your team !
        - https://ibb.co/NVdWpsv image-url; 
      ! Important: you may need to play around with ceratain abilities or stats or moves because PokemonShowdown formats have different rules which are complicated to overview.
        - make changes as needed
        - most often the format: "anything goes generation 9" works best
        - you also need to validate your team if everything is correct.
      => once team is build you can play with your friends or other ankimon users only and battle with your ankimon team
