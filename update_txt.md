## Ankimon News: Version 1.279:

## Update Notification

**More Fixes**: üîß

- **Trading Starter Pok√©mon**: Not able to trade out starter Pok√©mon for another Pok√©mon (only after reset) as main Pok√©mon has been fixed. If any users lost their starter Pok√©mon through this or still have issues, please create an issue on the Ankimon GitHub: [https://github.com/Unlucky-Life/ankimon/issues/](https://github.com/Unlucky-Life/ankimon/issues/) and send me your `mainpokemon.json` and `mypokemon.json` file in the `user_files` folder in the Ankimon Addon folder.

- **Huge Pok√©ball Icon**: The huge Pok√©ball icon not disappearing for users with "show main Pok√©mon in reviewer" setting set to 0 has been fixed.

- **Startup Issue**: Fixed the issue where Ankimon would not start up due to Pok√©mon over level 100.
    
### PLEASE READ:

**Mac Users:** When download the functions DO NOT go into fullscreen and don't let the computer hibernate/sleep while the files are downloading! This causes errors and issues with the Ankimon addon. If this happens to you, you need to uninstall and reinstall the addon and re-do the download process.
