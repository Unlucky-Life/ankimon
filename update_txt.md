### PLEASE READ:

**Mac Users:** When download the functions DO NOT go into fullscreen and don't let the computer hibernate/sleep while the files are downloading! This causes errors and issues with the Ankimon addon. If this happens to you, you need to uninstall and reinstall the addon and re-do the download process.

If any new issues appear with the update, please let us know over GitHub, instead of downvoting: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Unlucky-Life/ankimon/issues)
