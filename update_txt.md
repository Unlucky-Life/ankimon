## THANK YOU DOC!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èü©∑
### WE WILL MISS YOU ü´Ä

Dear Doc,

Even though I'm a newcomer to this server, you helped me figure out all of the Ankimon basics‚Äîfrom how to update to the latest Ankimon version, to which channel I should put my bug issues in. The fact that you personally invited me to the study library was very kind of you, and was the main reason I felt comfortable enough to join and engage with all of the wonderful Ankimon community members! Thank you for all of your support and encouragement~ 

Although you'll still be in the server, I'll miss your calming presence in the library. Just from chatting with you, I could tell you're a genuinely caring and kind person, who always takes the effort to ensure everybody feels welcomed and supported. Your strong sense of empathy and humility is truly admirable‚Äîlike when you make sure to always shout-out community members like h0tp and unlucky and cheer up your friends when they're feeling down. You ensure that everybody is always being kind, especially to themselves. I consider myself lucky to be able to get to know you, and I know the people in your life are incredibly lucky as well‚Äîfrom your friends, to family, to your patients.

I wish you nothing but success going forward! You are going to be an amazing physician, Doc. Please keep us updated and pop in from time to time. Best of luck on your specialization exams and the start of your work. I'll always be rooting you on!

Your Ankimon buddy,  
vi :))

PS: DOC SO GOATED HE SAVED THE ENTIRE WORLD WITH HIS AMAZING PRESENCE AND FRIENDSHIPS

Dear Doc,

What a journey it has been. It is a highlight in my time with Ankimon that I met a remarkable individual as yourself.

With this wonderful community, you have shown us that this is much more than just another Discord server. And we definitely do not fit that Discord mod meme stereotype xD

You handled the server so well and made it a welcoming community for all. That is what I have always believed at the core - an inclusive and self-sustaining community where everyone can join in and feel like a part of it. Not ignored, not left out, rather, we have someone new joining everyday. And it'll only grow further!

I woke up one day without having 3 DMs and 5 pings for Ankimon help, seeing 1000+ members, and I saw the chats filled with messages and 10 people in the voice channel. It made me happy to see how far the Ankimon community had come, and you were the driving force for it.

Brother, wishing you the best with this next chapter of your medical journey, and it has been an honour <3

Hello Mister Doc,

When people talk about the man the myth the legend it's always about you. The Avengers thank God every day that you are on our side.

From eternal "welcome" messages to study calls. You've been there, done that x).

Remember that one time you saved me when I fell into that river???

In all seriousness, good luck with your job homie. You got this.

Doc invited me to come study during a time when I was at maximal stress levels. Now I‚Äôve got a group of people to study with and work hard to achieve our goals together! Best of luck with the next step in your journey Doc!!

Doc was the first person I talked to in the server who was nice and welcoming, he invited me to study together, and it was such a nice feeling :D. While I still slacked a lot, his words helped and kept pushing me numerous times. I'll miss your constant presence Doc :(

Doc's timezone is practically the opposite of my usual study times, but I could still feel his immense presence in this server. Reading through all the chats is what prompted me to join in in the VC, and I'm really glad I did.  

Best of luck in this new segment of life! Extremely thankful for all that you do!

Dear Dr. Doc ~

You are welcome to join this server anytime to say hello~! Thank you for your help, contribution, and kindness to everyone here in Ankimon. You made sure everyone felt welcome including me. 

You are one of the kindest people I have ever met. To me, you were someone who listened to my concerns, helped me when I was a lost penguin, and gave me the name "Nurse Joy".

I and Ankimon server will always be here for you <3  
Now ~ go save lives Dr. Doc and good luck bro  
With love, your Nurse Joy <3

Dear Doc,

You really made me feel welcomed in this community the moment I entered the Ankimon Server <3  
I think you made a lot of people feel this way.  
Back then I did not know what a sweet, helpful, and funny person you are, but now I know and I will truly miss having you around a lot.  
You deserve all the best in your career and I am happy for you taking the next big step :)  
You can be really proud of yourself.

Also, I wanna thank you for being part of the reason why I was also able to meet other amazing like-minded people and I hope to see you still around for a long time.

Much love, Johanna

Sup Doc,

Cheers to like idk, 10 more years of study.

Kinda funny how we can spend so much time on a server we joined a few months ago, there must be a certain reason (Ankimon def ain‚Äôt it lmfao).

To see the effort and consistency of one person affecting every person nearby just from their determination, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll replicate it everywhere you go.

I thought of a meaningful mnemonic for ‚ÄòDoc‚Äô each letter representing something, here it is:  
(D)oc  
D(o)c  
Do(c)

Pretty creative if I say so myself.

Let‚Äôs make more memories, come to NZ lol

ya-ho doc!

weve only been talking for a few weeks but i honestly never expected wed get this close. im really glad i met someone like you and so glad i randomly clicked on that server link and ended up meeting you (and the rest of the ankimon gang)

i don‚Äôt usually say stuff like this, but ive genuinely been enjoying our convos. ure soo easy to talk to and fun to joke around with. i had so much fun listening to anime ops with you, nooby, and trung that one timee and when we vc‚Äôed with bunnyyy (even if my social battery was dying hsdhs). thanks for going along with me even when i say the weirdest shit ever. ure either very patient or just as freaky as i am. (i think we both know which it is). also! i really liked that we share so much in common. its kinda scary how similar we are sometimes shdhssh 

now that ure gonna be busier with the hospital and all, ill miss you a lot but i know ull do amazing! srsly. wishing you the best of luck!! and dont forget about us while ure out there saving lives or wtv ok? so yeeee. i love u. dont let that get to your head tho. :> ganbaaaa

‚Äì u should be able to guess by now who this is or ill be very disappointed.

Dear Doc,

Man, what can I say, I'm kinda speechless. I swear I'm normally better at writing huge appreciation texts. Here is the thing homie, I'm really glad to meet you through Ankimon. You're such a warming person and dedicate heart and soul to make others feel welcome, to feel seen and heard, and this is a quality that we can't find everywhere. You're a unique and awesome person, and I'm happy that we crossed paths.

As you begin this next step in your life, I wish you the best of luck. I hope you bring your best qualities into this internship, and will be cheering for you all the time, so people can notice and appreciate all the love and kindness you bring into the world (even online). You brought even more life to this community, and I'm truly grateful you're a part of this.

Brother, I'm a hugger, so receive my huge online hug and please reach out if you need anything.

Go and make the world a better place with you as their doctor.  
With love,  

‚Äì Peace

hola doc,

just wanted to say how much i appreciate everything you‚Äôve done for our ankimon community. you‚Äôve brought so many cool people together and made the space feel super chill and welcoming. it honestly wouldn‚Äôt be the same without you (pls give us a visit everyday and make sure we‚Äôre mining). 

i really love how you never judge anyone. you always try to understand where people are coming from, and you make everyone feel included (even when you‚Äôre roasting them a little). you‚Äôve got a big heart and it shows. We LOVE YOU. 

one of my favorite moments was when you, durian, and i got on voice during break. i was laughing so hard i couldn‚Äôt even breathe. it was one of those moments where i was like ‚Äúdamn, i have amazing friends‚Äù. 

so yeah, thank you for being you. i‚Äôm really glad we‚Äôre friends and cheers to more funny memories in the future. 

‚Äì bunny
