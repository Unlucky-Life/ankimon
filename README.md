Ankimon is an Anki addon designed to gamify your learning experience by allowing you to catch, collect, train, and fight with Pokémon within the Anki environment. With Ankimon, learning becomes an adventure where you can enhance your knowledge while having fun.

## Important Notes

- **Linux OS** Before reporting an issue on Linux, make sure you check if it works with the package downloaded directly from the [Anki github](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases) as it could be a problem with the package maintained by a third party (distro maintainer or flatpak)
- **Addon Status:** Ankimon is still in development. Please report any bugs you encounter to help improve the addon.
- **Backup Files:** Before updating the addon, ensure to copy your "mypokemon.json" and "mainpokemon.json" files to prevent data loss before any updates. Please check out my GitHub Ankimon Page before updating - I will let you know when an update is coming in.
- **Compatibility:** Currently, Ankimon is **only compatible with PyQt6**. Updates for compatibility with other versions will be provided in the future.
