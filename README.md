This Anki add-on introduces an innovative approach to managing and accessing Anki decks through encrypted links. It is designed to enhance the security and privacy of users who wish to share or distribute their Anki decks.
The key features of this add-on are as follows:

**Link Encryption**: The add-on encrypts links to Anki decks, ensuring that the actual URLs are not visible to the user or anyone who might access the user interface. This encryption adds an extra layer of security, protecting the decks from unauthorized access.

**Password-Protected Access**: Users can download and access the encrypted decks, but only by entering the correct password. This feature ensures that only those with the appropriate permissions can access the content of the decks.

**User Interface Concealment:** The add-on provides a user interface that does not display the encrypted links. This design choice further enhances security by hiding the direct paths to the decks.

**Secure Sharing and Distribution**: The add-on is particularly useful for educators, students, and professionals who want to share their Anki decks with specific individuals securely. It ensures that only intended recipients, who have the password, can access and download the decks.

Overall, this add-on is an excellent tool for users who prioritize the security and controlled distribution of their Anki decks. It adds an essential level of protection and privacy to the sharing process, making it suitable for sensitive or proprietary content.
